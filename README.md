# A brief look at U.S. energy consumption trends during the pandemic

 
The purpose of this exercise is to take a brief look at electricity consumption and generation trends during the beginning of the Covid-19 outbreak in the U.S. It is fairly common knowledge that fossil fuel consumption, and with it prices have plummetted during the outbreak, and this peaked my curiosity as to what, if any, effect the pandemic is having on the electric grid.
